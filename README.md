# Multi-Agentic-AI-RAG-With-Vector-Db
This project is a PDF-based AI assistant built on the phi framework that ingests and semantically indexes PDF content using pgvector in a Dockerized PostgreSQL environment. It leverages advanced vector search to answer natural language queries, providing contextually relevant responses while maintaining conversation history via a Typer-based CLI.
